# Velvet-Worms-First-Project
# Velvet-Worms-Project-1

# Project Overview
## Project Name
"Ask The Cosmos" or "Ask The Universe"

## Project Description

In this project I will create a site that will 'answer' a question with either a 'Yes' or 'No' accompanied with an embedded GIF.  A user's will be confirmed as a question by checking for the presence of a '?'. User input will be confirmed as a question before the answer is given to the page.

## API and Data Sample

I will be using the "YesOrNo" API: http://yesno.wtf/api/

Sample JSON: 
    
    "answer": "yes",
    "forced": false,
    "image": "https://yesno.wtf/assets/yes/5-64c2804cc48057b94fd0b3eaf323d92c.gif"
}

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Save user input history on page

#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Add second API
- Use local storage to save user favorites

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Nov. 6-7| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete
|Nov. 8| Project Approval | Incomplete
|JNov. 8| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|Nov. 9| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|Nov. 10| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|Nov. 11| MVP | Incomplete
|Nov. 12| Presentations | Incomplete

## Priority Matrix

-Complete HTML skeleton

-Build primary function of site in JS: question input and API return

-Secondary Function: If user input isn't a question display an error gif and message.  Store previous question locally.

-Heavy CSS design: Stylize site logo, site text.

## Timeframes
 
Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 4hrs| N/A | N/A |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| N/A | N/A |
| Initial JS | H | 5hrs| N/A | N/A |
| CSS Styling | H | 5hrs| N/A | N/A |
| non-MVP Goals | H | 5hrs| N/A | N/A |
| Total | H | 22hrs| N/A | N/A |
