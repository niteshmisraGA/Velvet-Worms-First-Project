# Velvet-Worms-Project-1

# Project Overview
## Project Name
"Ask The Cosmos" or "Ask The Universe"

## Project Description

In this project I will create a site that will 'answer' a question with either a 'Yes' or 'No' accompanied with an embedded GIF.  A user's will be confirmed as a question by checking for the presence of a '?'. User input will be confirmed as a question before the answer is given to the page.

## API and Data Sample

I will be using the "YesOrNo" API: http://yesno.wtf/api/

Sample JSON: 
    
    "answer": "yes",
    "forced": false,
    "image": "https://yesno.wtf/assets/yes/5-64c2804cc48057b94fd0b3eaf323d92c.gif"
}

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Save user input history on page

#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Add second API
- Use local storage to save user favorites
